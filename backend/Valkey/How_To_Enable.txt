Why Valkey:
    Valkey is a key value database that stores values in memory, it is ideal for us to keep session-data in valkey because
    we are constantly fetching session data on each protected endpoint, and memory is much faster.

    I have re-written the session logic using Session Manager, the only cookie we keep in the front-end now is the session ID.
    We also rotate the session_id every six hours, but we don't really expire the cookies we just set a new one.
    All session data is now kept in the backend which is why we only set session-id in the front-end for security purposes.

    We use gin context to set the session variables on each protected route as such:
    user_id := c.Keys["user_id"].(string)

    Using valkey is completely optional for now. Using docker compose is quite easy though. Once most devs have docker installed we
    can add mongo into the docker compose, and remove the need to install docker manually.
