The structure of the project follows a
model, route, controller framework

The project also contains a helper folder, 
each helper is inclosed in it's own 
folder such that they can encompass their own package.

This allows use to treat each helper as a static class, that we can call 
for common tasks needed on the controllers.


Since go does not discern on the basis of file at the package level
all controllers functions are actually methods belonging to empty
structs/classes that share their name with the file. 
This is done purely for namespacing purposes when in the routes folder. 

Ex: 

//empty struct
type User_controllers struct {
}
//method belonging to that struct
func (u *User_controllers) GET_me(c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(200, "Hello from user routes")
}
